          <p>Are you a beginner? want to get started with open source contribution? If your answer is -Yes, then go ahead and read the post, you may find some usefull stuffs.  </p>
<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Outreachy</h3>

<p>Seriously saying- Outreachy is an opportunity for me. Outreachy helps me to grab an internship in the organization I want to contribute for. Outreachy is a program to code, learn and collaborate with amazing open source Organization. This is an amazing platform to build something. This is a kind of Google summer fo code internship program, but the difference is, this program is only open to women (cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people internationally. For more you can visit <a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/" class="user-mention">here</a>  </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to get started</h3>

<p>First thing that matters a lot is, the Organization. First, select an organizaion according to your area of interest and your skills (the most important thing). Are you a newbie? you don't have any technical knowledge yet?- No problem at all!! There are some documents related projects offered by organizations, you can submit proposal for that. It will be highly recommend to choose project according to you skills. For example- If you have knowledge of javascript, choose projects that required JS knowledge. Point to be noted here, "You can learn advanced topics of a particular programming language during the internship, but it is not possible to learn language from scratch and then work on project". </p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How did I get started</h3>

<p>One of my senior in college told me about this program. I will be always thankful to him. It was 3rd March, I was just going through the program website and then through the organizations and then projects. It was very hard for me to decide organization. Yes, its true, till that I was not sure about which organization I want to contribute for. Afterwards, I gone through the projects of Mozilla, One project which caught my eyes was <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Outreachy#Make_Firefox_look_great_on_desktop.21_.5Bno_longer_taking_applicants.5D" class="user-mention">"Make firefox looks great on desktop"</a> . I don't know why but my cursor always  stopped there. So I gone through the link my mentor provided for getting started with project. When I was done with setup and all, I contacted my mentor <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Gijs/" class="user-mention">Gijs Kruitbosch</a>.

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Big Question- What is important contribution or proposal? </h3>

<p>At the end of program period, I had 5 patches merged in firefox. So, at that time exactly the same question was going around in my mind. So I asked this to my mentor- ‚ÄùWhat is important contribution or proposal?‚Äù And his response was satisfying enough. He says "For me, your involvement in project is more important but you can't ignore proposal". Yes, Contribution shows your skills and knowledge, but proposal conclude everything- your skills, knowledge, experience, And the most important your involvement in project. It's important because in some organization your mentor is not the one who is reviewing your proposal, so take care of this.</p>

<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Result day</h3>

<p> During the program my mentor told me one thing that was soul satisfying:   
<strong> "It's been impressive -- to the point where I've needed to go find more work for you to do!" </strong> Yes!! I solved all bugs he mentioned in the wiki for Linux operating system. I always ask him for more bugs.</p> The result day 22nd April. In this round there was change in result declaration time(In last round it was 7:00 PM UTC but in this round it was 4:00 PM UTC) when I was going through wiki It was 7:00pm UTC, afterwards it was updated. And I was unaware of this update (I still think about this, and say WTH!!). That day one of my friend messaged me exactly at 9:30 pm (4:00 pm UTC) - "Hey Rakhi, Why they didn't declare result yet its 9:30 pm- with this she provide me the the link of wiki too". And when I clicked on that link, result were published.. Ahh, I was blank at that time, And then just saw my name- ohh my gosh... It's me!!! I don't know why but I was in silent mode for few minutes :P . I am Super excited to work with my mentor <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Gijs/" class="user-mention">Gijs Kruitbosch</a> He is the best mentor I ever have.</p>

        <h1>Firefix for Desktop.</h1><section id="main_content">
        <p>This is first week- According to the schedule.But I have started working on project from 10 days before the formal-start, just after my semester-end exam. In this blog I am going to writes about my project that is- Firefox for desktop! I will be working on all three platform- Linux, Window and mac OSX.
          <p> Firefox for desktop is used by hundreds of millions of people every day. Infact I am using firefox from the day I bought by laptop. Firefox is a web browser available for both desktop and mobile versions. Firefox use Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implement current web standards. Developers control what it looks like using CSS, XUL (a markup language that's a bit like HTML), and JavaScript. There's also a small amount of C++ here and there.</p>

<h3>Little history about Firefox</h3>
         <p>The Firefox project began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt, Joe Hewitt and Blake Ross.Mozilla Firefox (or simply Firefox) is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. Firefox is available for Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems, with its mobile versions available for Android.Firefox version 1.0 was released on November 9, 2004. According to Mozilla, as of December 2014 there were half a billion Firefox users around the world With Internet Explorer declining, Firefox reached second place in February 2016, as a desktop browser.</p>
          <h3>Goal Of Project</h3>
          <p> The project is devided into two categories- 
            <p>1. Development of new styles- for all three platform</p>
            <p>2. Fixing existing issues- There is a number of styling problems where Firefox does not currently look its best- Again for all three platform. </p>
           As I use ubuntu in my system, So I decided to go with linux first. During my intial contribution (During application period) I Fixed almost issues of firefox for platform -Linux. I was unaware of this-  my mentor told me recently!. Currently I am working on development of Bookmark styling in toolbar- I am going to write about this in my next blog.
</p>

        <h1>Bookmark in toolbar </h1><section id="main_content">
        <p>So, Today let's talk about Bookmark issue in toolbar as that is what I have been up to the past couple of weeks along with some other issues. Yes, I know I should have write about it 2 weeks ago but I was kind of busy with some stuffs along with my internship.üò¶ That‚Äôs why didn‚Äôt find time to dedicate a proper blog to my work. In this blog I will write about Bookmark issue in toolbar and some interesting things I encountered while working with it. </p>
        <h3>What the exactly issue is:</h3>
        <p>Here, basically the borders and backgrounds should be the same as for the navigation toolbar buttons. The styling for :hover and [open="true"] states of the bookmarks toolbar items looks inconsistent with the remaining theme and is outdated. I need to update these to match the appearance of other buttons on the nav-bar. In short I am going to use Australis button styling for bookmarks toolbar items. 
        Please note that- Australis is basically just a codename for the current styling of the toolbars in Firefox.</p>
